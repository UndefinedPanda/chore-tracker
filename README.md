# Chore Tracker For My Children

This is a basic chore tracker for my children. It is far from a "polished" project. It lacks Authentication and some proper validation. This is strictly for personal use, use at your own risk.

## What it does & why I made it
This is a simple REST api to create chores for my children, allowing them to mark it off when they're done. This is mainly to slowly teach my kids how to use a computer, as well as a small personal portfolio project.
